# Gamepress Dark-Lite - A Gamepress Darkening Stylesheet

Are you a fan of dark modes? Do you tend to use Gamepress' suite of sites when trying to navigate your favourite game? Do you prefer not to have your eyes blasted with white light when looking up for favorite waifu/husbando's upgrade details at night? Look no further!

*Author Warning/Note*: This Userstyle may not be entirely compatible with the varying Gamepress subsites. The testing I've done for this was applied mostly to the Fate/Grand Order Wiki, so it may not display as ideally for other Game Wikis like Genshin, FEH, etc. Feel free to raise any issues or submit PRs to enhance this work!

## Getting Started
*Please note that this entire **Getting Started** section is straight from [NyxMidnight](https://github.com/nyxmidnight/twitter-detox/blob/master/README.md)'s readme. All credits go to him for this formatting/documentation.*

### Prerequisites

This is a **user stylesheet** that gets applied to a website thanks to a **userstyle manager extension** installed in your browser. (In other words, this will not work on the Twitter **app**.) You will need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets. I personally use **Stylus** (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), for [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)).

### Installation

1.  Using a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets (see **Prerequisites**), open the raw file within the browser by clicking on the next link.
    :package: [Install the userCSS](https://github.com/ersgonzalo/eg-user-styles/raw/master/gamepress-dark-lite/gamepress-dark-lite.user.css)
2.  The userstyle manager will open the stylesheet. The sidebar on the left will have an **Install Style** button to install the user style. Below is a checkbox to receive updates. Leave it checked to automatically receive the updated stylesheet whenever I make changes because Twitter changed their code and broke the stylesheet.
3.  Click on the **Install Style** button to install the user style in your browser.
4.  Reload your Twitter timeline and enjoy the (slightly increased) peace and quiet!
