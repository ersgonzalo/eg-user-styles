# Qwiet-ter - A Quiet-Making Twitter Stylesheet

Are you tired of seeing the incessant uninformed comments on Twitter of users feeling the need to respond to everything? Do you typically lurk Twitter and use it as a information-gathering tool? Do you want to see less replies from users clogging up your feed and to spend less time drowning in toxicity? Use this Stylesheet!

## Getting Started
*Please note that this entire **Getting Started** section is straight from [NyxMidnight](https://github.com/nyxmidnight/twitter-detox/blob/master/README.md)'s readme. All credits go to him for this formatting/documentation.*

### Prerequisites

This is a **user stylesheet** that gets applied to a website thanks to a **userstyle manager extension** installed in your browser. (In other words, this will not work on the Twitter **app**.) You will need a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets. I personally use **Stylus** (for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), for [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)).

### Installation

1.  Using a userstyle manager that supports installing UserCSS stylesheets (see **Prerequisites**), open the raw file within the browser by clicking on the next link.
    :package: [Install the userCSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyxmidnight/twitter-detox/master/twitter-detox.user.css)

2.  The userstyle manager will open the stylesheet. The sidebar on the left will have an **Install Style** button to install the user style. Below is a checkbox to receive updates. Leave it checked to automatically receive the updated stylesheet whenever I make changes because Twitter changed their code and broke the stylesheet.
3.  Click on the **Install Style** button to install the user style in your browser.
4.  Reload your Twitter timeline and enjoy the (slightly increased) peace and quiet!
